# Assignment

First of all, thank you for the assignement. It was a fun assignment to do.
Hopefully my code will live to your standards and I can address certain choices in an interview.
I'm well aware that there are many ways how to approach a problem. Based on the time I had, this is what I came up with.

## Way of working

The first thing I did was create a small TODO list, which I left in App.tsx so you can see my process.

After this I focus on installation of React and other packages I needed.
For styling I used `styled-components`, to highlight that I'm also experienced with css-in-js.

I've tried to show that I try to work structured; separate files where I think is logical.
That being said; I see I can split it up even more and create more generic components, but considering the time, I just highlighted a part of it.

I also wrote a few small tests. Again; here I'm showing that I have experience with writing tests.

Thanks for reading and happy testing!
